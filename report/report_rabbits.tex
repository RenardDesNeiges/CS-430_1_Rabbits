\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Assumptions}
% Describe the assumptions of your world model and implementation (e.g. is the grass amount bounded in each cell) %

\subsection{Implementation Remarks}
% Provide important details about your implementation, such as handling of boundary conditions %

\section{Results}
% In this section, you study and describe how different variables (e.g. birth threshold, grass growth rate etc.) or combinations of variables influence the results. Different experiments with different settings are described below with your observations and analysis

\subsection{Experiment 1}

\subsubsection{Setting}

\subsubsection{Observations}
% Elaborate on the observed results %
